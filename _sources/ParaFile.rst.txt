Parameter file
==============

The paramater file is the central input of CryDisGen.

It is a structured ASCII text file designed to supply configuration details for CryDisGen. It uses a line-based format with different tags which may be followed by values or stand alone, and includes comments for clarity. The file is divided into sections that describe the crystal region and the defects to be introduced. Below is an inferred breakdown of its structure and key characteristics:

.. code-block:: CryDisGen
   :linenos:

   #lines starting with '#' are comments 
   #crystal region definition
   Region
   -x      1 -1  0      # lattice orientation along x-axis
   -y      1  1  0      # lattice orientation along y-axis
   -z      0  0  1      # lattice orientation along z-axis
   -lat    3.615        # lattice constant
   -pbc    1  1  1      # boundary condition flags along x/y/z-axes: '1' for periodic, '0'for non-periodic 

   #stacking fault tetrahedron

   Tetrahedron          # label for tetrahedron section
   -tc     0. 0. 0.     # center of the bottom face of the tetrahedron
   -tr     40           # radius of the circumscribed circle of the bottom face
   -tnorm -1 -1 -1      # outward normal direction at the tetrahedron's bottom face 
   -lxt    1 -1  0      # local x-axis at the bottom face
   -lyt   -1 -1  2      # local y-axis at the bottom face

   #dislocation loop
   nLoop   1            # number of dislocation loops
   Loop                 # label for dislocaiton loop section
   -bv     1  1  1      # orientation of Burgers vector

   -dnorm  1  1  1      # normal direction of dislocation plane
   -dc     0. 0  0      # center of dislocation loop

   -ly     1  1 -2      # local y-axis on dislocation plane 
   -ndisl  4            # number of segments/vertices in a discretized dislocation loop

   #dislocation helix
   nHelix  1            # number of dislocation helices
   Helix                # label for dislocation helix section
   -bvh    1  1  1      # orientation of the Burgers vector for the helix 
   -bsh    1/2          # scalar coefficient of Burgers vector, e.g., 1/2 in 1/2<110>
   -f      mesh.dat     # mesh data file of the helical surface

General Format
--------------
**Comments**: Lines beginning with # are comments, ignored by the program but used to annotate the file for user reading it (e.g., #crystal region).

**Tags**: Each non-comment line starts with a tag (e.g., Region, -x, nTetrahedron), often followed by numerical or symbolic values.

**Whitespace**: Tags and values are separated by spaces or tabs, with consistent spacing for readability.

**Sections**: Some tags (e.g., Region, Tetrahedron, Loop) act as section headers or labels, grouping related parameters.


Sections 
--------
**Crystal Region** 

* *Purpose*: Defines the lattice properties and boundary conditions of the crystal.

* *Tag*: 

  * *Region* (marks the start of this section).

**Stacking Fault Tetrahedron**

* *Purpose*: Configures stacking fault tetrahedrons (SFTs).

* *Tags*: 

  * *nTetrahedron*: Specifies the number of tetrahedrons to generate (e.g., 1).
  * *Tetrahedron*: Labels the start of a tetrahedron definition

**Dislocation Loop**

* *Purpose*: Defines dislocation loops.

* *Tags*:

  * *nLoop*: Specifies the number of dislocation loops (e.g., 1).
  * *Loop*: Labels the start of a dislocation loop definition.

**Dislocation Helix**

* *Purpose*: Defines dislocation helix.  

* *Tags*:

  * *nHelix*: Specifies the number of dislocation helix (e.g., 1).
  * *Helix*:  Labels the start of a dislocation helix definition.

Key Characteristics
-------------------
**Hierarchical Structure**: The file is organized into sections (Region, Tetrahedron, Loop), each with specific parameters, allowing modular defect definitions.

**Vector-Based Inputs**: Many parameters use three-component vectors (e.g., -x, -bv, -dnorm) to define orientations and positions in 3D space.

**Flexibility**: Supports multiple defects (e.g., nTetrahedron, nLoop) with customizable attributes, making it adaptable to various simulation needs.

**Units**: Assumed to align with MD conventions (e.g., angstroms for lengths), though not explicitly stated in the file.

**Readability**: Comments and consistent formatting enhance user understanding and editing.

Purpose and Usage
-----------------
This file serves as the ``parameter_file`` input for CryDisGen (as described in the :doc:`Usage <Usage>` section), complementing the ``crystal_file`` by defining defects to insert into the crystal structure. It enables users to specify complex dislocation configurations, leveraging CryDisGenâ€™s ability to generate realistic atomic-scale models.
