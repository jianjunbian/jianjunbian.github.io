Installation
------------

After downloading the binary file and saving it as ``CryDisGen``, open a Terminal window, navigate to the directory where ``CryDisGen`` is saved, and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   chmod +x CryDisGen
   
If it is needed, the path to ``CryDisGen`` can be added to the operating system's enviromental variable ``$PATH``. This allows ``CryDisGen`` to be executed anywhere without explicitly specifying its full path.  

Assuming ``CryDisGen`` is saved in a folder within the home directory, such as ``~/myfolder``, we can add its path to the enviromental varialbe ``$PATH`` by appending the following line to the ``~/.bashrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PATH=~/myfolder:$PATH

After completing the steps above, ``CryDisGen`` is sucessfully installed.
