*A straight screw dislocation is created in a single-crystal aluminum sample: the unrelaxed configuration ( left ) and the relaxed configuration ( right ). In the figures, atoms in perfect FCC lattice are not shown for clarity. White atoms are those at free surface, and red atoms are those in HCP lattice.*

.. note::
   To create a straight dislocation, one approach is to define a larger dislocation loop—at lease one dimension larger than the crystal sample—in the parameter file. By appropriately scaling and positioning the dislocation loop so that only a portion of one edge resides within the crystal domain, a straight dislocation can be successfully introduced into the sample after applying the associated displacement field of the dislocation loop. 

To create a straight screw dislocation in a single-crystal aluminum sample, the following two steps are employed: 

**Step 1:**

  Use the tool in the subdirectory :doc:`tools/Fcc <Tools>` to creat an FCC single crystal sample by running the following command in Terminal. This will produce an ASCII text file of the atomic structure in current directory: ``fcc_reg.lmp``.

.. code-block:: Shell 
   :linenos:

   Fcc 300 300 150 -l 1 -1 0 -m 1 1 -2 -n 1 1 1 Al

**Step 2:**

  Open terminal, run the following command:

.. code-block:: Shell 
   :linenos:

   CryDisGen para_file fcc_reg.lmp

   -bs     1/2          # scaling coefficient of Burgers vector, e.g., 1/2 in [110]/2
   -dnorm  1  1  1      # normal direction of dislocation plane
   -dc     0 -100 0.5   # center of dislocation loop
   -dr     200          # radius of dislocaiton loopS
   -lx     1 -1  0      # local x axis on dislocation plane 
   -ly     1  1 -2      # local y axis on dislocation plane 
   -ndisl  4  0.5       # segments of a discretized dislocation loop and a scaling factor

.. important::
   In this example, the parameter tag '-ndisl' accepts two arguments. When only a single argument is specified, the resulting dislocation loop assumes a square geometry. If a second argument is provided, it serves as a scaling factor for the loop edge oriented along the direction defined by the '-ly' tag, thereby enabling the generation of rectangular loop configuration.
