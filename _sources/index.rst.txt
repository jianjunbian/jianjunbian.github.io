About CryDisGen
*****************

CryDisGen represents **Cry**\ stal **Dis**\ location **Gen**\ erator.

CryDisGen is a scientific software tailored for researchers and engineers working with crystal structures. Originally developed by Bian et. al. from `Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology <https://www.xauat.edu.cn>`_ and `Xi'an Jiaotong Univeristy <https://www.xjtu.edu.cn>`_, CryDisGen empowers users to create precise atomic models of general dislocation structures in crystals. With its robust modeling capabilities, this free tool supports academic, non-commercial, and commercial applicationsâ€”making advanced crystallographic research more accessible and efficient. 
Now at version 1.0, CryDisGen is actively maintained with updates from its creators, ensuring reliable performance for its users.
