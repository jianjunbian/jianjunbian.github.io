Input and output files
======================

In this section, we explain the structure of the crystal file in detail. 

To seamlessly interact with ``LAMMPS``, both the input and output crystal files of ``CryDisGen`` adopt the same structure as data file recognized by the `read_data <https://docs.lammps.org/read_data.html>`_ command in ``LAMMPS``. Detailed information on the data file format can be found in the official document of `LAMMPS <https://docs.lammps.org/read_data.html>`_

Since ``CryDisGen`` is designed to work with crystal structures, only the data file of ``atomic`` type, as illustrated in `LAMMPS <https://docs.lammps.org/read_data.html>`_, needs to be considered. Below is an example of such a data file: 

 .. code-block:: shell 
    :linenos:

    3 1 -61.345233 -58.785847 -61.449741
    4 1 -60.067113 -60.063673 -59.642199
    ...

The data files contains a header section and a body section. Typically, the first line is a comment that provides some explainations of the file. The header section specifies the overall informaiton of the crystal structure, such as the number of atoms (line 3), the number of atom types (line 4), and the extent of the atomic region (line 6 ~ 8). The body section begins with keywords like ``Masses`` (line 10), ``Atoms`` (line 14). The ``Masses`` subsection defines the atomic weight of each atom type (line 12), the ``Atoms`` subsection consists of lines detailing individual atom information (line 16 ~ end of file). For a data file of the ``atomic`` type, the per-atom values have thes meanings and units as follows:

.. list-table::

   * - atomic
     - atom-ID atom-type x y z

* atom-ID = integer ID of atom
* atom-type = type of atom (1-Ntype, or type label)
* x, y, z = coordinates of atom (distance units)
