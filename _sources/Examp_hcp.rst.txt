*( a ) A single crystal HCP sample and the four types of slip planes in the lattice. ( b ~ e ) Demonstrated squre-shaped dislocation loops on the basal, prismatic, the 1st order pyramidal and the 2nd order pyramidal slip planes in HCP atomic structures. In the figures ( b ~ e), atoms in perfect HCP lattice are not shown for clarity, and the remaining atoms compose the dislocation cores.*

To create a dislocation loop withing a single-crystal magnesium (Mg) sampel, the following two steps are employed: 

**Step 1:**

  Use the tool in the subdirectory :doc:`tools/Hcp <Tools>` to creat an HCP single crystal sample by running the following command in Terminal. This will produce an ASCII text file of the atomic structure in current directory: ``hcp_reg.lmp``.

.. code-block:: Shell 
   :linenos:

   Hcp 100 100 100 -x 2 -1 -1 0 -y 0 1 -1 0 -z 0 0 0 1 Mg

**Step 2:**

   Open terminal, run the following command, and one square-shaped dislocation loop will be created on the basal slip plane.

.. code-block:: Shell 
   :linenos:

   CryDisGen para_file hcp_reg.lmp

   -dc     0  0  0         # center of dislocation loop
   -dr     30              # radius of dislocaiton loop
   -lx     null            # local x-axis on dislocation plane, and will be caculated by the code
   -ly     null            # local y-axis on dislocation plane, and will be caculated by the code
   -ndisl  4               # segments of a discretized dislocation loop

.. important::
   In this example, the parameter tags ``-lx,-ly`` accept one argument ``null`` each, which indicates that the local coordinte axes on the dislocation plane will be calculated by the code automatically.
