*A straight edge dislocation is created in a single-crystal aluminum sample: the unrelaxed configuration ( left ) and the relaxed configuration ( right ). In the figures, atoms in perfect FCC lattice are not shown for clarity. White atoms are those at free surface and dislocation core, and red atoms are those in HCP lattice.*

--------

.. note:: 
   To create a straight edge dislocation, one approach is to generate a pure edge dislocation loop with a square shape in a way similar to that of generating an intrinsic Frank dislocation loop. However, instead of removing a {111} atomic plane, two adjacent {110} atomic planes are deleted in present case. By scaling and positioning the square dislocation loop so that only a portion of the edge lies within the crystal region, an strainght edge dislocation can be inserted after applying the displacement field of the dislocation. 


To create a straight edge dislocation withing a single-crystal aluminum sampel, the following two steps are employed: 

**Step 1:**

  Use the tool in the subdirectory :doc:`tools/Fcc <Tools>` to creat an FCC single crystal sample by running the following command in Terminal. This will produce an ASCII text file of the atomic structure in current directory: ``fcc_reg.lmp``.

.. code-block:: Shell 
   :linenos:

   Fcc 300 300 150 -x 1 -1 0 -y 1 1 -2 -z 1 1 1 Al 

**Step 2:**

  Open terminal, run the following command:

.. code-block:: Shell 
   :linenos:

   CryDisGen para_file fcc_reg.lmp

   -y      1  1 -2      # lattice orientation along y-axis
   -z      1  1  1      # lattice orientation along z-axis
   -lat    4.05         # lattice constant 
   -pbc    1  1  0      # boundary condition flags along x/y/z-axes: '1' for periodic, '0' for non-periodic

   -bv     1 -1  0      # orientation of Burgers vector
   -bs     1/2          # scaling coefficient of Burgers vector, e.g., 1/2 in [110]/2
   -dnorm  1 -1  0      # normal direction of dislocation plane
   -dc     0  0  80     # center of dislocation loop
   -dr     180          # radius of dislocaiton loop
   -lx     1  1 -2      # local x-axis on dislocation plane 
   -ly     1  1  1      # local y-axis on dislocation plane 
   -ndisl  4  0.5       # number of segments/vertices in a discretized dislocation loop and a scaling factor

.. important::
   In this example, the parameter tag '-ndisl' accepts two arguments as well, and the second argument is a scaling factor used to scale the edge length of the dislocation loop along the defined direction specified by the '-ly' tag.
